**The Concept is Simple**

In Ranked Fortnite games, you’ll usually encounter at least 1 to 5 players using aimbot or wallhacks in every match. On average, only once every 7–9 games does one of these cheaters get eliminated before the end.

So, if you want to rank up in Fortnite, your best strategy is learning how **not to die to cheaters**.

Personally, my method is simple: **avoid them entirely**. If you're skilled at building and running away, let them get distracted by someone else.

**This Guide is About One Thing: Surviving and Earning XP**

While you’re waiting for the aimbot cheaters to wipe out the lobby, why not use that time to **maximize your Battle Pass XP**?

Think of it like a **speedrun challenge**:
Earn the **maximum XP** possible **before the game ends**, without engaging in combat.

**Challenge Rules: No Kills Allowed**

* Do **not kill** any players — at all.
* Even if you're in the **top 2**, **you still cannot eliminate the last player**.

  * If you respect their time, eliminate yourself.
  * If you want to waste their time, try to get them killed **without directly helping** (traps, fall damage, etc.).
* If Fortnite counts your actions as an **assist or elimination**, **you fail the challenge**.

**Why No Kills?**

My channel is called **"Code Bots to Fight Bots"**. The goal is to get eliminated by a wallhack cheater who sees you as an easy target on their wall hack software.
Once you’re dead, you **spectate** them to determine whether they’re using **aimbot or wallhacks**.
If they are, **record the footage using OBS Replay Buffer** and **report them**.

Eventually, I plan to **automate the process** of fighting back against these cheaters.
But first, I need to **develop code that can read player positions from the map and minimap.**.


If you play this challenge account wild. **ALL KILL** must be documented and if possible recorder. Be ready to do replay buffer. If you dont see the kill or dont recorded. note the date the hours of when you realized it and the current count.

Kill by walling is not changing the kill count so it is ok to be the top 1 of the game.
