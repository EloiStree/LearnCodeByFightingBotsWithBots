# Learn to Code by Fighting Bots with Bots in WoW

> This workshop is designed to teach general coding skills and game-specific coding for QA testers who want to learn by battling bots in *World of Warcraft* with bots.

I‚Äôm a teacher who really loves coding.  
Coding bots is fun üòÅ!  

But like everyone else‚Ä¶ I **f**\*ing hate\*\* bots *in-game* ü§¨.  
I've spent hours killing them and reporting them.  

So... I'm going to teach you how to code bots.  
But you have to promise me one thing:  
**"Report them all."**  

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING:** You *will* get banned ‚Äî sooner or later.

## Objective  

By the end of the workshop, you will be able to:

* [ ] Code in C# at a junior developer level  
* [ ] Write simple Python scripts  
* [ ] Use Lua to create WoW addons  
* [ ] Build a Raspberry Pi Pico mouse/keyboard/controller  
* [ ] Build an ESP32-based keyboard  
* [ ] Build an ESP32-based controller  
* [ ] Simulate up to four Xbox controllers  
* [ ] Read single pixels from the screen  
* [ ] Read color data from:  
  * [ ] The game screen & Unity3D apps  
  * [ ] A webcam   
* [ ] Take in-game screenshots    
  * [ ] Record audio  
  * [ ] Record video replays  
* [ ] ... and more!  

My goal, as you can probably tell, is to create junior QA developer jobs through a fun exercise that also helps the community.

## Side Effects of Bot Software

### üß∞ Hardware Accessibility: ‚ÄúNo Hands‚Äù

When you can simulate a keyboard, you can begin building tools for accessibility.
I‚Äôll be crafting some guides on how to use arcade buttons, Raspberry Pi, and ESP32 to make games more accessible.

**Your mission:**
Contact a local organization that supports people with disabilities.
Invite them into the *World of Warcraft* by running through this workshop together.

### üéÆ Blind Gaming

Telemetry built for bots can be repurposed to provide game context for visually impaired players.
I‚Äôm actively working on this. If you want to collaborate, feel free to ping me.

**Your mission:**
Find a visually impaired gamer and help them play *World of Warcraft*.
_Contact me if you're up for this challenge._


Here's a rephrased and corrected version for clarity and natural English:

### üëì XR Quest 3

While experimenting with telemetry using Color, I discovered that it's possible to export data through the webcam.
Now that we have access to the Quest 3‚Äôs camera, we can explore the possibility of playing **World of Warcraft** in augmented reality on the device without networking pairing.

**Your mission:**
Test the potential of playing **World of Warcraft** in front of your TV using the Quest 3.

**May the code be with you.**
