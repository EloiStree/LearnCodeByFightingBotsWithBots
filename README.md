# Learn to Code by Fighting Bots with Bots in WoW

> This workshop is designed to teach general coding skills and game-specific coding for QA testers who want to learn by battling bots in *World of Warcraft* with bots.

I‚Äôm a teacher who really loves coding.  
Coding bots is fun üòÅ!  

But like everyone else‚Ä¶ I **fking hate** bots *in-game* ü§¨.  
I've spent hours killing them and reporting them.  

So... I'm going to teach you how to code bots.  
But you have to promise me one thing:  
**"Report them all."**  

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING:** You *will* get banned ‚Äî sooner or later.  

---  

## Objective  

By the end of the workshop, you will be able to:

* [ ] Code in C# at a junior developer level  
* [ ] Write simple Python scripts  
* [ ] Use Lua to create WoW addons  
* [ ] Build a Raspberry Pi Pico mouse/keyboard/controller  
* [ ] Build an ESP32-based keyboard  
* [ ] Build an ESP32-based controller  
* [ ] Simulate up to four Xbox controllers  
* [ ] Read single pixels from the screen  
* [ ] Read color data from:  
  * [ ] The game screen & Unity3D apps  
  * [ ] A webcam   
* [ ] Take in-game screenshots    
  * [ ] Record audio  
  * [ ] Record video replays  
* [ ] ... and more!  

My goal, as you can probably tell, is to create junior QA developer jobs through a fun exercise that also helps the community.

(Note: If you extend this exercise to store a database of the bots and create a website to collect them, you can learn all the skills a junior developer needs in their career.)

## For free ?

My income comes from teaching across Belgium and from donations.
In the future, I plan to organize online coding eSports tournaments as living.
All of my code is open source and released under the Beerware license.
So if you'd like to support me and my work, feel free to send me a beer every now and then on APInt.IO !

## Side Effects of Bot Software

### üß∞ Hardware Accessibility: ‚ÄúNo Hands‚Äù

When you can simulate a keyboard, you can begin building tools for accessibility.
I‚Äôll be crafting some guides on how to use arcade buttons, Raspberry Pi, and ESP32 to make games more accessible.

**Your mission:**
Contact a local organization that supports people with disabilities.
Invite them into the *World of Warcraft* by running through this workshop together.

### üéÆ Blind Gaming

Telemetry built for bots can be repurposed to provide game context for visually impaired players.
I‚Äôm actively working on this. If you want to collaborate, feel free to ping me.

**Your mission:**
Find a visually impaired gamer and help them play *World of Warcraft*.
_Contact me if you're up for this challenge._



### üëì XR Quest 3

While experimenting with telemetry using Color, I discovered that it's possible to export data through the webcam.
Now that we have access to the Quest 3‚Äôs camera, we can explore the possibility of playing **World of Warcraft** in augmented reality on the device without networking pairing.

**Your mission:**
Test the potential of playing **World of Warcraft** in front of your TV using the Quest 3.


### ü§ñ QA testing Company

You are a quality assurence company and you are reading this page.
Contact me üòä.
I am going to teach QA testing by using code in game by 2026:
- I would be happy to redirect young developer to you for internship.
- I would love talk about what you need as automated tools.
- I would love to see if we can create the ultimate Quest3 QA testing hub.


### ü§ñ AI in game

Would really love to see how an AI would behave on a private server with Wow classic.
If you are learning in university how to create AI and want to experiment the concept.
Feel free to contact me. 

(_Something that could be fun and useful, is to create an ChatBot that can talk with the people botting. In aim for them to expose in chat that they are botting and information about them that could be useful for the Game Master._)




### Sus-Points

You can find here notes I write when I think about an anti-bot idea while creating them:

**May the code be with you.**
