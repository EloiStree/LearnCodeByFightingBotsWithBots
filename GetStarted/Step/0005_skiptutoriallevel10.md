When you arrive in the game, you need to do the tutorial.  
But in reality, you just need to be level 10.   
    
So a solution is to kill the mob in the boat until level 10.  
  
Problem, all new and old player start here.  
So the best solution is to create 4-6 accounts and try to connect them all on the same boat.   
 
Blocking the group and avoiding human.  
Then it is a tab > 1 macro and we are good to go.   

Try to connect them all in the same moment at a time no player are there.
