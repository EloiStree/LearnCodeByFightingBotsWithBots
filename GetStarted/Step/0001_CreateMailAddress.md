If you are going to create bot, you are going to need mail address.

You can create around 10-40 accounts using gmail, yahoo , mail...
But at one point you are going to need more.

Until Blizzard add your @website.com to they suspision list.
You need to create a website.

I am using [one.com](https://www.one.com/en) and [https://best-hosting.cz/en](https://best-hosting.cz/en)

I am on their service because they are hosting Raspberry Pi:

Create your account with a mail option
(I let's you do that yourself)

Now you should have a mailsboxes

Go in the mailboxes:

Create an alias

Request to send the mail sent to hardcore@website.com to your mail
<img width="807" height="336" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf89f4fc-4a78-4775-b94e-64706779e525" />

Now that you created an account your can create one.
